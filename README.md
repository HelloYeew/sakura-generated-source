# Sakura Generated Source

Classes generated from [Sakura](https://github.com/HelloYeew/sakura) source generator (Sakura.Framework.SourceGenerator) for extending functionality in the framework and reducing code duplication.

This repository is for reference and for visibility only. All of these classes are already contained in the framework package and will be automatically generated during build time. Since sometime this repository is not always up to date, please refer to the framework package for the latest version.

For Sakura source generator usage and how to obtain the generated code, please refer to the [Sakura repository](https://github.com/HelloYeew/sakura) for more details. (TODO: Add usage documentation)
